# DreamerDog-V2
This is the complete new code of DreamerDog, everything is written from scratch again.

What's new?
 - Upgraded to DiscordJS V12.
 - Command handler, rather than using a single file for the program.
 - Thanks to the command handler, existing commands can be reloaded without needing to restart the bot.
 - Command cooldowns.
 - Permissions are now handled once in the index.js, rather than hardcoding permissions over and over again for every command.
 - Added support for command aliases .
 - Added an advanced help command that automatically adds new commands.
